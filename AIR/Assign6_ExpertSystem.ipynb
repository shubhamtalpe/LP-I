      "Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Normal body temperature is around 98.6 F (37 C). Hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh) occurs as your body temperature falls below 95 F (35 C).\n",
      "\n",
      "When your body temperature drops, your heart, nervous system and other organs can't work normally. Left untreated, hypothermia can eventually lead to complete failure of your heart and respiratory system and eventually to death.\n",

      "Hypothermia is often caused by exposure to cold weather or immersion in cold water. Primary treatments for hypothermia are methods to warm the body back to a normal temperature.\n",

      "Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss.\n",
      "Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia, and advanced age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of 36.5â€“37.5 Â°C (97.7â€“99.5 Â°F) through thermoregulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",

      "Passive rewarming: For someone with mild hypothermia, it is enough to cover them with heated blankets and offer warm fluids to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood rewarming : Blood may be drawn, warmed and recirculated in the body. A common method of warming blood is the use of a hemodialysis machine, which is normally used to filter blood in people with poor kidney function. Heart bypass machines also may need to be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warm intravenous fluids: A warmed intravenous solution of salt water may be put into a vein to help warm the blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Airway rewarming: The use of humidified oxygen administered with a mask or nasal tube can warm the airways and help raise the temperature of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Irrigation: A warm saltwater solution may be used to warm certain areas of the body, such as the area around the lungs (pleura) or the abdominal cavity (peritoneal cavity). The warm liquid is introduced into the affected area with catheters.\n",

      "\n",
      "Arthritis is Inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain and stiffness that can worsen with age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthritis is very common but is not well understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different types of arthritis exist, each with different causes including wear and tear, infections and underlying diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. When the cartilage â€“ the slick, cushioning surface on the ends of bones â€“ wears away, bone rubs against bone, causing pain, swelling and stiffness. Over time, joints can lose strength and pain may become chronic. Risk factors include excess weight, family history, age and previous injury (an anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, tear, for example). \n",
      "\n",
      "Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels.\n",
      "\n",
      "An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "X-rays\n",
      "Blood Tests\n",
      "MRI\n",
      "CT Scans\n",
      "\n",
      "The common medications and procedures suggested by other real doctors are: \n",
      "\n",
      "Arthritis treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving joint function. You may need to try several different treatments, or combinations of treatments, before you determine what works best for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medications\n",
      "The medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Commonly used arthritis medications include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Analgesics. These medications help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs reduce both pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Oral NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation, and some may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs slow or stop your immune system from attacking your joints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapy\n",
      "Physical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercises can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgery\n",
      "\n",
      "If conservative measures don't help, your doctor may suggest surgery, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Joint repair. In some instances, joint surfaces can be smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. These types of procedures can often be performed arthroscopically â€” through small incisions over the joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joint replacement. This procedure removes your damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one. Joints most commonly replaced are hips and knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joint fusion. This procedure is more often used for smaller joints, such as those in the wrist, ankle and fingers. It removes the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit.\n",
